### Branch Naming Convention

* `feature/` - New features (e.g., `feature/add-oauth-login`)
* `bugfix/` - Bug fixes (e.g., `bugfix/fix-memory-leak`)
* `hotfix/` - Urgent fixes for production (e.g., `hotfix/security-patch`)
* `docs/` - Documentation updates (e.g., `docs/update-api-docs`)
* `refactor/` - Code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/optimize-queries`)
* `test/` - Test additions or fixes (e.g., `test/add-unit-tests`)

### Commit Message Convention

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
* `feat`: A new feature
* `fix`: A bug fix
* `docs`: Documentation only changes
* `style`: Changes that don't affect code meaning (formatting, etc.)
* `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* `perf`: Code change that improves performance
* `test`: Adding or correcting tests
* `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**
```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login support

Implemented Google and GitHub OAuth2 providers with proper
token refresh mechanism and secure storage.

Closes #123
```

### Code Style

#### TypeScript/JavaScript
* Use ESLint and Prettier configurations provided
* Run `npm run lint` before committing
* Use meaningful variable and function names
* Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

#### Python
* Follow PEP 8
* Use Black for formatting (`black app tests`)
* Use type hints where applicable
* Add docstrings to all functions and classes

### Testing

#### Frontend Testing
```bash
cd packages/frontend

# Run unit tests
npm run test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```

#### Backend Testing
```bash
cd packages/backend

# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_auth.py
```

### Documentation

* Update README.md if you change installation or usage instructions
* Add/update API documentation for new endpoints
* Include inline comments for complex logic
* Update type definitions when changing interfaces

## Review Process

1. **Automated Checks**: All PRs must pass CI/CD checks
2. **Code Review**: At least one maintainer review required
3. **Testing**: All tests must pass
4. **Documentation**: Must be updated if applicable

## Release Process

We use semantic versioning (SemVer):

* **MAJOR** version for incompatible API changes
* **MINOR** version for backwards-compatible functionality additions
* **PATCH** version for backwards-compatible bug fixes
