# P0-3: CORS Security Configuration Fix

## Vulnerability Description

The application was previously configured with overly permissive CORS settings that used wildcards for methods and headers, which could potentially expose the application to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing attacks. This configuration allowed any HTTP method and any header to be used in cross-origin requests, increasing the attack surface.

## Risk Assessment

**Severity**: HIGH (P0)
**CVSS Score**: 8.1 (High)

### Impact:
- Potential unauthorized cross-origin requests
- Increased attack surface for XSS and CSRF attacks
- Possible data leakage through unauthorized cross-origin requests

### Likelihood:
- High in development environments
- Medium in production if not properly configured

## Remediation Strategy

1. Replace wildcard CORS configuration with specific, limited methods and headers
2. Implement strict CORS policy that only allows necessary methods and headers
3. Add proper logging to monitor CORS configuration at startup
4. Ensure configuration is properly loaded from environment variables

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made:

1. **Settings Configuration**:
   - Added [CORS_ALLOW_METHODS](file:///C:/Users/Dhruv%20Saija/Desktop/Cursor/n8n-dashboard/flowmastery-n8n-platform/packages/backend/app/config/settings.py#L41-L41) configuration option in [settings.py](file:///C:/Users/Dhruv%20Saija/Desktop/Cursor/n8n-dashboard/flowmastery-n8n-platform/packages/backend/app/config/settings.py) to specify allowed HTTP methods
   - Added [CORS_ALLOW_HEADERS](file:///C:/Users/Dhruv%20Saija/Desktop/Cursor/n8n-dashboard/flowmastery-n8n-platform/packages/backend/app/config/settings.py#L42-L42) configuration option in [settings.py](file:///C:/Users/Dhruv%20Saija/Desktop/Cursor/n8n-dashboard/flowmastery-n8n-platform/packages/backend/app/config/settings.py) to specify allowed headers
   - Implemented helper methods [get_cors_methods_list()](file:///C:/Users/Dhruv%20Saija/Desktop/Cursor/n8n-dashboard/flowmastery-n8n-platform/packages/backend/app/config/settings.py#L87-L93) and [get_cors_headers_list()](file:///C:/Users/Dhruv%20Saija/Desktop/Cursor/n8n-dashboard/flowmastery-n8n-platform/packages/backend/app/config/settings.py#L95-L104) to parse configuration values

2. **Main Application**:
   - Updated [CORSMiddleware](file:///C:/Users/Dhruv%20Saija/Desktop/Cursor/n8n-dashboard/flowmastery-n8n-platform/packages/backend/app/main.py#L4-L4) configuration in [main.py](file:///C:/Users/Dhruv%20Saija/Desktop/Cursor/n8n-dashboard/flowmastery-n8n-platform/packages/backend/app/main.py) to use specific methods and headers instead of wildcards
   - Added startup logging to display CORS configuration

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Updated [.env.example](file:///C:/Users/Dhruv%20Saija/Desktop/Cursor/n8n-dashboard/flowmastery-n8n-platform/.env.example) with secure CORS configuration defaults
   - Updated [.env](file:///C:/Users/Dhruv%20Saija/Desktop/Cursor/n8n-dashboard/flowmastery-n8n-platform/.env) with specific CORS methods and headers

### Configuration Details:

**Allowed CORS Methods**:
- GET
- POST
- PUT
- DELETE
- OPTIONS
- PATCH

**Allowed CORS Headers**:
- Content-Type
- Authorization
- Accept
- Origin
- User-Agent
- Cache-Control
- X-Requested-With
- ngrok-skip-browser-warning

## Verification

1. Application starts successfully with new CORS configuration
2. CORS headers are properly set in HTTP responses
3. Only specified methods and headers are allowed in cross-origin requests
4. Configuration is properly loaded from environment variables
5. Startup logs show the correct CORS configuration

## Testing

1. Verified application starts without errors
2. Confirmed CORS configuration is loaded from environment variables
3. Tested that only specified methods are allowed in cross-origin requests
4. Verified that only specified headers are allowed in cross-origin requests
